This is likely to be a total hack it's entire life. If you fork this and mess
with it, well, have fun, but no guarantees.

It's supposed to take some of the book-keeping out of running combats in GURPS

The idea is to get it working reasonably well from irb first, then go back and
make it more user-friendly with some kind of CLI.
